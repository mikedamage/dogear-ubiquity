h2. About DogEar

*DogEar* is a set of commands for "Mozilla Ubiquity":http://ubiquity.mozilla.org that keeps a list of web pages you want to read later (a-la the "Read It Later" Firefox extension). It uses Mozilla's FUEL library to store a JSON object in Firefox's preferences with the names, URLs, and thumbnail images (coming soon) of pages you want to stash away for later reading without having to bookmark.
